# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN with Attention üëÄ

Welcome to the Pneumonia Detection project! This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with attention mechanism to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Below, you'll find information on the dataset used for training, how to access the trained model, and where to find the hosted application.

## Dataset
For training the pneumonia detection model, the [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle was used. This dataset contains X-ray images of healthy and pneumonia-infected lungs.

## Hosted Application
The trained model is hosted on the Hugging Face Spaces platform. You can access the application [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/likith123/pneumonia-detection). The application allows you to upload a chest X-ray image and get predictions on whether pneumonia is detected.

## Model Access
Due to the large size of the model files (2.5GB each), it's recommended to access the model through the Hugging Face hosted space. You can download the model from the provided link in the application space.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Pneumonia-detection-Using-CNN-attension.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application script:

```bash
python app.py
```

4. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to access the application locally.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the model, add features to the application, or fix bugs are welcome! Please open an issue to discuss proposed changes or submit a pull request directly.
